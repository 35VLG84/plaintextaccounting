% PTA Cookbook

This is the Plain Text Accounting Cookbook,
a place to collect additional practical-minded PTA docs aimed at getting useful things done,
often not app-specific.
If you don't see what you need, ask for it in the 
[[index#news-discussion|chat]] and we'll add it, or you can
[add it yourself](https://github.com/plaintextaccounting/plaintextaccounting/blob/master/src/Cookbook.md).
